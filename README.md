&nbsp &nbsp eta.py sends a text to a cellphone number's email address. The text contains information on when a user should arrive at a destination. ETA is calculated with real time traffic conditions using Mapquest.com's free api.

<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp I created this script during my time at Rithm School because I have a four hour roundtrip commute on a bus. My wife would ask about my eta constantly due to us having two little rascals that she had to take care of by herself. So, when I got on the bus in San Francisco, I would turn on my laptop and run this app, which would send my wife a text with my eta.

<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp I use Mapquest.com's API because it is free. Google Maps is everyone's preferred mapping service, but it is no longer free.
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp My start position is hard coded because I would use the bus' wifi. The bus' wifi geo location was somewhere in Marin. So, using the bus' geo location wasn't an option. My original plan was to use the geo location to send an eta on an interval based off of the distance remaining on the bus ride.
